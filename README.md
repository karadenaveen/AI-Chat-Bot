# ðŸ¤– AI Chatbot for Cancer Data Tagging

#Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered chatbot using LLM-based Generative AI to analyze and categorize free-text medical records from a cancer dataset. The chatbot automatically classifies data into predefined taxonomy-based categories, improving efficiency in medical data processing and analysis.

#Features
âœ… Automated Free-Text Tagging â€“ Identifies and categorizes medical complaints, causes, and corrections.
âœ… LLM-Based Generative AI â€“ Utilizes advanced NLP models for accurate classification.
âœ… Taxonomy-Based Classification â€“ Maps medical text into structured categories for better insights.
âœ… Enhanced Medical Data Structuring â€“ Improves decision-making in oncology research and clinical analysis.

#Technology Stack
-Python (FastAPI, Flask) â€“ Backend API for chatbot interactions
-Transformers (Hugging Face, OpenAI GPT) â€“ NLP model for medical text processing
-YOLO (Optional) â€“ If used for image-based annotations in medical data
-Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data preprocessing and analysis
-SQLite / PostgreSQL â€“ Database for storing structured medical text
-Docker â€“ Containerization for deployment
